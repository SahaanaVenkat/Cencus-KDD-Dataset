The United States Census Bureau leads the countryâ€™s Federal Statistical System; its primary responsibility is to collect demographic and economic data about America to help inform strategic initiatives. Every ten years, the census is conducted to collect and organize information regarding the US population with the intention of effectively allocating billions of dollars of funding to various endeavors (e.g., the building and maintenance of hospitals, schools, fire departments, transportation infrastructure, etc.). Additionally, the collection of census information helps to examine the demographic characteristics of subpopulations across the country.
